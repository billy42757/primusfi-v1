*“The Future of Prediction Markets & Building the Conviction Economy”*

Prediction markets are about to change. Traditional markets reward money and luck more than belief, leaving ordinary users at a disadvantage.

Primus Markets reward participants for their true belief and commitment, not just on how much they stake. This creates fairer, stronger, and more reliable markets capable of discovering real-world outcomes.

With this approach, we are tapping into a trillion-dollar opportunity in global betting, speculation, and derivatives.

Primus introduces a conviction-based, chain-agnostic financial protocol designed to turn belief into measurable on-chain value.

Users stake on events and get rewarded - the earlier and longer someone backs their belief, the greater the reward. Unlike traditional markets, this favors conviction over speculation.

Through a USDT-pegged conversion system, users convert stable liquidity into aligned partner tokens and participate in conviction pools that reward belief, time, and alignment.

Primus is not tied to any single Layer 1 or 2 - it is a belief infrastructure where liquidity supports conviction, and conviction builds ecosystems and rewards believers.
